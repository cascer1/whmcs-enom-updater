### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the module. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). If you'd like, you can use [this template](#template-for-submitting-bug-reports) to structure the information.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [debugging guide](https://github.com/ducohosting/whmcs-enom-updater/wiki/Debugging).** You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem [in the latest version of the module](https://github.com/ducohosting/whmcs-enom-updater/wiki/Checking-for-updates).
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/ducohosting/whmcs-enom-updater/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by describing your hosting environment. Make sure to be very detailed when explaining the steps you performed. Instead of saying you ended up on some page, tell us *exactly* how you got there (which buttons did you press?).
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Does this problem only occur for a specific TLD? Maybe it only happens when your eNom balance is below a certain level. Give us as much detail as you think is required.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, you can use [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If you're reporting a Fatal Error**, include the PHP error log and any errors you saw on your screen. Include the error log in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem is related to performance**, include as many details about your environment as possible. Think of the CPU you use, what operating system/version, which WHMCS version, your distance to the server and anything else that might help us.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of the module) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of the module?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of the module from [the releases page](https://github.com/ducohosting/whmcs-enom-updater/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to the eNom API? (e.g. getting the eNom prices), **does the problem happen for all TLDs or only some?** Does this problem only happen with a certain type of TLDs (like country TLDs, or those requiring extra registrant information)?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of the module are you using?** You can get the exact version by visiting the WHMCS addon modules page
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're running WHMCS on**?

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the module? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Pull Requests

* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Follow the [styleguide](#code-styleguide)
* Document new code based on the
  [Documentation Styleguide](#documentation-styleguide)
